# IPSubnet-Andriod
Summary:
Andriod application for viewing, calculating, and displaying split IP addresses on a mobile device.

Disclaimer:
Current Version is not on app store and is currently a work in progress for personal use. If you would like to download and modify this code for personal use then feel free! This is a personal project for my father who requested an application for a subnet calculator drawing inspiration from a web application that does something similar.
