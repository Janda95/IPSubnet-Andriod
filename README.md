# IPSubnet-Andriod
Andriod application for viewing, calculating, and splitting IP addresses within your personal network.


Current Version is not on app store and is currently a work in progress for personal use. If you would like to download and modify this code for personal use then feel free! This is a personal project for my father who requested an application for a subnet calculator drawing inspiration from a web application that does something similar.
